# The First Year - Baby App :baby:

## About
This is an app dedicated to showing the progress of a baby's first year through pictures. This, in essence, is a virtual version of the photo frames that a lot of parents and grandparents have that show baby's pictures every month up until their first birthday.

## Aproach Taken

I initially was doing a completly diffrent app for this last project. However as time went by I decided to do something a bit more personal. I watched a lot of tutorials to break down the diffrent steps for me. I really want to understand the logic behind the code more than coding to code. My approach initially was to just code but after hitting a block it became study/research and then code. 

## Unsolved Problems/ Future Proposed Updates

In the future, I would like to add more statistics such as height and weight of baby and maybe a fun fact of what the baby likes or does at a particular month. I would also like to add authentication and possibly more profile information for the person who is using the baby app.

## Notes

I plan to go back with more time and complete this project. It seemed fun to do and would love to finish with more knowledge.
